```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(337px, auto));
```

	The `grid-template-columns` property in CSS Grid is used to define the size and number of columns in a grid container. In the specific example you provided:

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(337px, auto));
```

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **`repeat()` Function:**
   - The `repeat()` function is used to repeat a pattern in the grid definition. It takes two arguments: the number of times to repeat the pattern, and the pattern itself.

   ```css
   repeat(auto-fit, minmax(337px, auto))
   ```

2. **`auto-fit` Keyword:**
   - The `auto-fit` keyword is used as the first argument of `repeat()` to automatically fit as many columns as possible in the available space. It creates as many columns as can fit within the container.

3. **`minmax()` Function:**
   - The `minmax()` function defines a size range for the columns. It takes two arguments: the minimum size and the maximum size.

   ```css
   minmax(337px, auto)
   ```

4. **`337px` (Minimum Size):**
   - The minimum size of each column is set to `337px`. This means that, under normal circumstances, each column will be at least `337px` wide.

5. **`auto` (Maximum Size):**
   - The maximum size of each column is set to `auto`. This allows the columns to grow beyond the minimum size when there is extra space available.

### Explanation:

- The `auto-fit` keyword is particularly useful in responsive design. It allows the browser to automatically adjust the number of columns based on the available space. If the screen is wide, more columns will be created; if the screen is narrow, fewer columns will be created.

- The `minmax(337px, auto)` ensures that each column is at least `337px` wide but can expand beyond that if there is more space available.

- This combination of `auto-fit` and `minmax()` is commonly used to create responsive grid layouts where the number of columns adjusts based on the viewport size, providing a fluid and adaptive design.
